# Tullock_CVAS
In this repository we have provided the python code for computing equilibrium bid for Tullock (lottery) in the case of common value affiliated setting (Milgrom and Weber [1982]). We have considered the mineral right setting as explained below

f(V) = U[a,b],  f(x_i|V) = U[V-eps,V+eps] i ={1,2,..,N} (see Kagel et al. 1987)
V: Valuation 
x_i: Signal of player i


# Running command
python Tullock_mineral_right_Final.py N eps a b
For Ex: python Tullock_mineral_right_Final.py 2 6 25 125
